# my-odin-projects
This repository showcases all the projects I built during my learning journey through **The Odin Project's Full Stack Curriculum** (https://www.theodinproject.com/). The projects range from simple static websites, created with plain HTML and CSS, to more complex applications developed using JavaScript and frameworks like React and Express. Some applications also utilize relational database systems such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. Each project's purpose was to apply the knowledge gained throughout the curriculum. This repository serves as a portfolio, highlighting my acquired skills and demonstrating my growth as a full-stack web developer.

Feel free to take a look at the individual project folders for more details on each one. Keep in mind that this is a work in progress!
