# Etch-a-Sketch

This project focuses on applying the knowledge acquired from the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript Foundations** courses of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to create a simple **sketchpad**.

Through this project, I mainly learned how to **manipulate the DOM** and how to **use JavaScript events** effectively to create interactive elements on a webpage.
